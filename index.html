        <p class="c2">I see you found my second page. Are you following me?<br>
        Since you are here, why don't you take the time to look around.<br>
        The background was snagged off of the web.<br>
    I have managed to link to some things that I did myself quite some time ago.<br>
If you can find them, don't be too hard on them.<br>
I do admit that they have the makings of what art work would look like if <br>

Thanks for stopping by.</p>
